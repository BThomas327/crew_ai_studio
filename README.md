# CrewAI Studio

Welcome to CrewAI Studio! This application provides a user-friendly interface written in Streamlit for interacting with CrewAI, suitable even for those who don't want to write any code.

## Features

- **No coding required**: User-friendly interface for interacting with CrewAI.
- **Conda and virtual environment support**: Choose between Conda and a Python virtual environment for installation.
- **CrewAI tools** You can use crewai tools to interact with real world. (with crewAI-tools bugfix: RagTool based tools now handle post-creation passed parameters correctly [ #<49>](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI-tools/pull/49))
